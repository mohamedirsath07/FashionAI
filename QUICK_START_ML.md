3. 🎨 Intelligent color combination analysis

---

## 🏃 How to Test Right Now

### Step 1: Make Sure ML Backend is Running

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to your backend folder (adjust path as needed)
cd path\to\your\backend

# Start the ML backend on port 8000
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**Verify it's working:**
- Open: http://localhost:8000/docs
- You should see FastAPI Swagger docs with `/predict-type` and `/recommend-outfits` endpoints

---

### Step 2: Your Frontend is Already Running! ✅

Your dev server is running on port 5000:
```
✓ Server: http://localhost:5000
✓ Vite HMR: Active (hot reloading enabled)
```

---

### Step 3: Test the ML Features

1. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. **Test Auto Type Detection:**
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Go to "Upload Your Clothes" (Step 1)
   - Upload 3-5 clothing images
   - ✅ Watch for badges appearing at bottom-left of images showing detected type
   - ✅ You'll see "Detecting..." spinner briefly, then type appears (top, bottom, shoes, etc.)

3. **Test AI Recommendations:**
   - Click "Continue" to Step 2
   - Fill in your name, age, gender
   - Select an occasion (try "Casual" first)
   - ✅ Look for the purple "Get AI Recommendations" button
   - Click it and wait 2-5 seconds
   - ✅ AI outfit combinations appear below with match scores

4. **Test Color Analysis:**
   - Look at any AI-generated outfit card
   - ✅ Check "Items & Colors" section
   - ✅ Each item shows a colored dot (hex color swatch)

- Shows 3-5 outfit combinations
- Match scores 0-100%
- Loading states and error handling

### 3. ML Outfit Cards (MLOutfitCard.tsx)
- 2x2 image grid
- Match score with sparkle icon
- Color swatches for each item
- Occasion badge
- Type labels on images

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to get AI recommendations"
**Solution:** Make sure ML backend is running on port 8000
```powershell
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Type detection shows "other" for everything
**Solution:**
1. Check if backend is running: http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Try uploading different images
3. ML might need better quality images

### No outfit cards appear
**Causes:**
- Need at least 3 clothing items uploaded
- Backend might not have enough variety (need tops, bottoms, shoes)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### CORS errors in console
**Solution:** Backend should allow CORS from your frontend:
```python
# In backend main.py
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Or specify ["http://localhost:5000"]
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Upload Flow:
```
1. Upload image
   ↓
2. Quick filename check (instant)
   ↓
3. If unknown → ML detection (0.5-2s)
   ↓
4. Badge appears with type
```

### Recommendation Flow:
```
1. Select occasion
   ↓
2. Click "Get AI Recommendations"
   ↓
3. Loading: "AI is analyzing..." (2-5s)
   ↓
4. Results: 3-5 outfit cards appear
   ↓
5. Each shows match score, items, colors
```

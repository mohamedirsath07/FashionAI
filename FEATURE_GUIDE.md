## ⚙️ Firebase Configuration

### Required for Library Feature

The Image Library uses Firebase Storage. To enable it:

1. **Read the Setup Guide**: Open `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. **Create Firebase Project**: Free at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
3. **Enable Storage**: In your Firebase project
4. **Get Credentials**: Copy your Firebase config
5. **Update Config**: Edit `client/src/lib/firebase.ts`

**Without Firebase Setup:**
- ❌ "Save to library" toggle will be disabled
- ❌ "My Library" will show setup instructions
- ✅ Everything else works normally (local upload & recommendations)

### Quick Firebase Config

Edit `client/src/lib/firebase.ts`:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abc123"
};
```

### Data Flow

1. **Upload → Firebase**:
   ```
   User uploads image → Convert to File
   → Upload to Firebase Storage
   → Get download URL → Save to state
   ```

2. **Library → Session**:
   ```
   Fetch from Firebase → Display in grid
   → User selects → Add to session state
   → Available for recommendations
   ```

3. **Recommendations**:
   ```
   Uploaded items → Classify (top/bottom)
   → Extract colors → Pair combinations
   → Calculate scores → Display results
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing in Recommendations
- **Check**: Did you upload at least 1 top and 1 bottom?
- **Check**: Look at the type badge on uploaded images (should show "top" or "bottom")
- **Fix**: Rename files to include "shirt" or "pants" for better detection

### "Save to Library" Disabled
- **Cause**: Firebase not configured
- **Fix**: Follow `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Alternative**: You can still use the app without Firebase (local mode)

### Library Shows "Setup Required"
- **Cause**: Firebase credentials not updated
- **Fix**: Edit `client/src/lib/firebase.ts` with your Firebase config
- **Check**: Make sure to replace ALL placeholder values

### Colors Don't Match Images
- **Current**: Colors are generated algorithmically (consistent per image)
- **Future**: Will implement actual color extraction from image pixels
- **Workaround**: The color indicators are for visual differentiation

## 🚀 Running the App

### Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend + Express
cd DataBridge
npm run dev
# Running on: http://localhost:5000

# Terminal 2: ML Backend (Optional)
cd DataBridge/backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# Running on: http://localhost:8000
```

### Just Frontend (Local Mode)
```bash
cd DataBridge
npm run dev
```
Everything works except Firebase library features.

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Image upload with type detection

## 💡 Tips

2. **Library Organization**: Firebase automatically timestamps your uploads
3. **Quick Testing**: Use library toggle OFF for faster testing
4. **Performance**: Library images load from CDN (fast!)
